# Advanced-Neural-Networks-Projects
Projects from my master's level course on advanced neural networks


Project 1:
  Using the letters of the alphabet as 5-by-7 dot matrices, I implemented a perceptron for each letter. The perceptron outputs 1 for its assigned letter and 0 for all other         letters.
 
Project 2:
  Using the EMNIST Letters dataset, the goal of this project was to use and improve upon an MLP neural network. To do this I started with the mnist_mlp.py architecture which was     provided. I then modified all parts of the network to try to improve the accuracy.
  
Project 3:
  This project was similar to project 2, but with using a CNN architecture on the EMNIST dataset. The process followed the same steps, I started with the mnist_cnn.py               architecture, and then explored and improved upon it to increase the accuracy.
